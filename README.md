# Password-Manager
Hello friend welcome to my Password Manager project 


This is a very basic program i created using Python and it is very safe to use 


All the passwords are saved in JSON file and are encrypted. You can access it but wont understand the password



Make sure you have a Reliable python version which is compatible with the libraries (My Python version is 3.11)


Libraries needed : Tkinter, pyperclip, Fernet, random, json


Install them using


``` PIP is the best
pip install <LibraryName>

```


Do me a favor if you like it do reach out to me and let me know  ðŸ˜Š


If other people like it do give me some credit ðŸ˜œ


Make sure your pip works 

And that will be it!!
